Some Sass mixins

<section>
  <h2>Literally just some mixins</h2>
  <p>
    I got tired of copypasting CSS between projects so I made myself a little
    mixin library. It's open source so you're welcome to look around and even
    use some of it if you like, but it's not a Serious Project intended for
    general purpose use. So don't run this command.
  </p>
  <pre><code>yarn add @henrycatalinismith/picknmix</code></pre>
  <p>
    A lot of the mixins here are part of a little classless CSS theme I've
    cobbled together. I wanted to be able to throw together quick mini websites
    for my other projects with just a bit of HTML and a theme on top. None of
    the existing options put enough love into their accessibility for my
    tastes, so I made my own.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of these mixins are super well documented but that's not a promotional
    strategy for driving adoption. The docs are mainly there to help future me
    remember what this stuff all does. They're also partly there to try and
    convince future me that it still works, cos I tend to lose faith in code I
    haven't touched in a while if I didn't document it.
